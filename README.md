## 📦 Getting Started (Running This Project)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
DATABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

You can find these in your Supabase project settings. The `DATABASE_URL` is required for running migrations.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Database Migrations

Apply the database schema to your Supabase instance:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 📖 Database Schema

The database schema is defined in the `supabase/migrations` directory. Here is the primary table structure:

### `job_applications`

```sql
-- 1. Create the job_applications table
create table public.job_applications (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  company text not null,
  role text not null,
  date timestamp with time zone not null,
  status text check (status in ('Applied', 'Interviewing', 'Offer', 'Rejected')) not null,
  notes text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- 2. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
alter table public.job_applications enable row level security;

-- 3. Create RLS policies
--    - Users can only view their own applications.
--    - Users can only insert applications for themselves.
--    - Users can only update their own applications.
--    - Users can only delete their own applications.
create policy "Users can view own applications" on public.job_applications for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can insert own applications" on public.job_applications for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can update own applications" on public.job_applications for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can delete own applications" on public.job_applications for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This schema ensures that each user's data is secured and accessible only by them, leveraging Supabase's built-in Row Level Security.
